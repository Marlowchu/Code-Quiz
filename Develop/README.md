I started this task by doing some pseudo coding. I then identified the parts needed in order to build this project. I started with simple HTML to get an idea of what was going to be displayed. I created buttons to track input and navigate. When the start button is pressed it starts the countdown and displays the first question and answers. When the user makes a selection of an answer my code determines if the answer is correct or incorrect by comparing a pre-defined answer with the user's choice. If the choice is incorrect the user losses 7 seconds. Once the user selects a choice the next question and answers are displayed. This continues to happen until all the questions are answered or the time runs out. When questions are all complete or time runs out the user is presented with “All done” text, their score, an input box, and a submit button. The user inputs their name in the input box and press the submit button. The name and score are then saved to a scores page that can be assessed before the user starts the quiz. While on the scores page the user can go back to the quiz or clear the scores.
